Grocery Store & Restaurant Simulation Progress Log 🚀🍽️
---

Milestones Completed:
1. 📁 Project structure organized with /src, /assets, /public, /logs, etc.
2. 🌟 Three.js scene set up with camera, lighting, and renderer.
3. 🏪 Realistic grocery store layout: perimeter walls, aisles, bakery, deli, restrooms, warehouse, and self-checkout area.
4. 🎮 Navigation controls: WASD to move, Q/E to move up/down, arrow keys to look, Shift for speed boost.
5. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Worker and customer agents added to the scene.
6. 🚪 Store entrance and self-checkout area implemented.
7. 🛒 Customer agents now enter, wander aisles, check out, and exit with pathfinding, queueing, and collision logic.
8. 👷 Worker agents hover near self-checkout counters.
9. 🎥 Camera view optimized for a clear, centered, downward angle.
10. 🧩 Project logic modularized into agentController, pathfinding, and fixtureLoader modules.
11. 🧺 Customers pick up baskets, browse dynamically throughout the store, and return baskets.
12. 👤 Interactive customer stats: click any customer to view a real-time stats card (time in store, money, mood, shopping list, etc.).
13. 📊 Stats overlay displays live data for all customers.
14. 🗂️ Shopping lists are now distributed evenly across all aisles, and each item is associated with a specific aisle.
15. 🧭 Customers' waypoints are generated to visit the correct aisles for their shopping list.
16. 💡 A 'clue' mechanic ensures customers find their items as time passes at an aisle, preventing them from getting lost.
17. 👁️ Stats overlay now has a Show/Hide button and is hidden by default.
18. 📝 Customer stats card and overlay always display item names and aisles, never [object Object].
19. 📉 MB Stats panel at the bottom left shows FPS, agent count, and memory usage.
20. 🧩 Codebase modularized: logic, maps, and GUI now separated for grocery and restaurant (e.g., /logic/grocery, /logic/restaurant, /gui/grocery, /gui/restaurant)
21. 🍽️ Restaurant simulation added: new map, customer and worker agents (host, waiter, busser, cook), table seating, and order assignment
22. 🔄 Unified Show/Hide Stats button and overlay logic for both scenes
23. 🖥️ Scene switching via dropdown; overlays and UI now context-aware and extensible
24. 📊 Dual progress bars per restaurant customer: order lifecycle (placed → cooking → delivering → served) and consumption, with dynamic UI and analytics-ready state.
25. 🔁 Restaurant customer looping: customers leave when done eating, new customers are seated at the same table, and the process repeats indefinitely.
26. 📝 Session logging at restaurant closing: logs total revenue, customers served, and order breakdown. Menu and pricing logic modularized for analytics.
27. 🏆 Restaurant stats overlay now lists table numbers and customer numbers for easy occupancy tracking (orders are shown in a separate overlay)
28. 📦 Downloadable session analytics: "Download Report" button saves a .json summary of the day (revenue, table stats, capacity, etc.)
29. 🌐 Local network deployment: run with `npx vite --host` and access from any device on your WiFi
30. 🍽️ Default scene is now Restaurant for quick demo and analytics

Current State:
- Both grocery and restaurant simulations are fully modular, with clear separation of logic, maps, and GUI overlays.
- Unified UI and stats overlays adapt to the current scene.
- Codebase is organized for future expansion and maintainability.
- Analytics and session logs are easily downloadable for business intelligence and charting.

Pending/Next Steps:
- 🛒 Implement item pickup and basket return logic.
- 😃 Add more agent behaviors (shopping lists, mood effects, etc.).
- 🖼️ Visual improvements: 3D models for agents, shelves, counters, and items.
- 🧑‍💻 UI/UX enhancements for stats and controls.
- 🚀 Performance optimization for larger agent counts.
- 🌍 Prepare for deployment (Netlify, asset optimization).
- 🔊 Add sound effects or background music for immersion.
- 💾 Save/load simulation state or session logs.
